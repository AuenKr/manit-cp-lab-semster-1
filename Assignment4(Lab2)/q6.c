/*
decimal number between 0 and 32 exclusive can be expressed in binary system as x4x3x2x1x0, where xiâ€™s are either zero or one. Write a C program that accepts (from the terminal) a decimal number in the above range and prints out the equivalent binary representation with leading bit 1.
Test data and expected output:
Enter a +ve no less than 32: -5
Entered number is out of range
Enter a +ve no less than 32: 21
Binary equivalent of decimal number 21 is 10101
Enter a +ve no less than 32: 14
Binary equivalent of decimal number 14 is 1110
Enter a +ve no less than 32: 35
Entered number is out of range
