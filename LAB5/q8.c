/*
Write a C program that reads a real number x from the keyboard and calculates the sum of the exponential 
by adding terms as long as |tn| > 10âˆ’8. Also, print out the value from the C math library function exp(x).
Test data and expected output:
Enter the value of x:1.5
Sum of the series at 1.50 is 4.48169e+00
Value from C math library=4.48169e+00
Enter the value of x:-20
Sum of the series at -20.00 is 2.06115e-09
Value from C math library=2.06115e-09
